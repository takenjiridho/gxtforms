#summary GXTForms dependencies are now in maven central, so builds are easy.

This doc assumes you are familiar with maven and are able to check out the source code.

After checkout, executing 'mvn install' from the root of the project will create a jar file and deploy it to your local repository.  At this point, you can declare gxtforms as a dependency of your app. Look at the gxtforms-demo in the trunk of svn for an example usage of the library.
