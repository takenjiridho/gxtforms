#summary Here's some info about using the library.

You might want to have a look at the source code for the demo here:

   http://code.google.com/p/gxtforms/source/browse/trunk/gxtforms-demo/

The demo application has client source and annotations tabs at the bottom for an example:

   http://gxtforms.appspot.com/

The only thing that the demo doesn't really illustrate is the web.xml entries needed.  Here's what the demo app's FormService declaration looks like:

{{{
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>FormService</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.googlecode.gxtforms.server.FormServiceImpl</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>FormService</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/com.googlecode.gxtforms.demo.Application/FormService</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
}}}


If you're so inclined to run the demo application locally, check out the source from svn and execute:

   mvn gwt:run

from the root of the demo source.  You'll need the gxtforms library installed to your local repo first.
